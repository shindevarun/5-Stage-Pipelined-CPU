# Lab1 - Register File

Lab1 builds a 32x64 register file (32, 64-bit registers). The registers are built using D-flip-flops (each register is an array of 64 D-flip-flops that hold a 1-bit value each). A 5:32 enabled decoder and two 32x64 to 64 multiplexors are used as well to implement all read/write logic to the register file.
